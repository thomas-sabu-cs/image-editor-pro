## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Image Editor Pro follows a clean, modular architecture based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

### Project Structure

│   └── main_window.py     # Main application window

└── README.md            # This file
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Models (`models.py`)
- **Layer:** Represents a single image layer with properties (opacity, visibility, name)
- **Project:** Manages multiple layers, canvas dimensions, and rendering

#### 2. Commands (`commands.py`)
- Implements the Command pattern for undo/redo functionality
- Each action (draw, add layer, apply filter) is encapsulated as a command
- **CommandHistory:** Manages undo/redo stacks

#### 3. Filters (`filters.py`)
- Pure functions for image processing
- Uses PIL/Pillow and NumPy for efficient operations
- Filters: blur, sharpen, brightness, contrast, hue/saturation, etc.

#### 4. Canvas (`canvas.py`)
- **Canvas:** Main drawing widget, handles mouse events and rendering
- **CanvasScrollArea:** Provides zoom and pan functionality

#### 5. Panels (`panels.py`)
- **LayerPanel:** UI for layer management
- **ToolOptionsPanel:** UI for tool settings and color picker

#### 6. Main Window (`main_window.py`)
- **MainWindow:** Integrates all components
- Handles menu actions, file operations, and signal routing

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
   - Models: `Layer`, `Project`
   - Views: `Canvas`, `LayerPanel`, `ToolOptionsPanel`
   - Controller: `MainWindow`

2. **Command Pattern**
   - All operations are commands that can be undone/redone
   - Enables flexible history management

3. **Observer Pattern**
   - Qt signals/slots for component communication
   - Loose coupling between components

4. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Different filters as interchangeable strategies
   - Easy to add new filters

## 🔧 How to Contribute/Extend

### Adding a New Filter

1. Add your filter function to `src/filters.py`:

```python
@staticmethod
def my_new_filter(image: Image.Image, param1: float) -> Image.Image:
    \"\"\"Apply my new filter.
    
    Args:
        image: Input PIL Image
        param1: Filter parameter
        
    Returns:
        Filtered image
    \"\"\"
    # Your filter implementation
    return processed_image
```

2. Add menu action in `src/main_window.py` in `setup_menus()`:

```python
new_filter_action = QAction("My New Filter", self)
new_filter_action.triggered.connect(lambda: self.apply_filter("My New Filter"))
filter_menu.addAction(new_filter_action)
```

3. Add filter application logic in `apply_filter()` method

### Adding a New Tool

1. Extend the `Canvas` class in `src/canvas.py`
2. Add tool selection in `ToolOptionsPanel` in `src/panels.py`
3. Implement tool behavior in mouse event handlers

## Testing

The project includes unit tests for filters and the undo/redo command system. Run the test suite with [pytest](https://pytest.org/).

### Running the test suite

1. Install dependencies (including pytest) from the project root:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run all tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

3. Run only filter tests or only command tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_filters.py -v
   pytest tests/test_commands.py -v
   ```

### What is tested

- **`tests/test_filters.py`** – Every filter in `src/filters.py` (Blur, Sharpen, Brightness, Contrast, Hue/Saturation, Grayscale, Invert, Edge Detect, Sepia, Posterize, Emboss, Smooth, Detail, etc.) is run on a small dummy image. Tests check that each filter returns a valid `PIL.Image.Image`, preserves dimensions, and (where relevant) output mode (e.g. Grayscale/Invert output mode). One test ensures filters do not mutate the input image.
- **`tests/test_commands.py`** – Command history and basic commands (Add Layer, Remove Layer, Filter, Draw, Opacity, Clear Layer, Resize) are tested. For each, the test performs an action, calls `undo()`, then `redo()`, and asserts that the project state (layer count, layer content, dimensions, opacity) is consistent after the round-trip.

### Running Tests (short reference)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Large images (>10000x10000px) may cause performance issues
- Undo history is limited to 50 operations by default
- Some filters may take time on large layers

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Selection tools (rectangular, elliptical, lasso)
- [ ] Text tool
- [ ] Shape tools (rectangle, circle, line)
- [ ] Layer masks
- [ ] Adjustment layers
- [ ] More filters (gaussian blur, motion blur, etc.)
- [ ] Brush presets
- [ ] History panel
- [ ] Export templates
- [ ] Plugin system
